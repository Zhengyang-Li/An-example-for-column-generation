# An-example-for-column-generation

Here is an example of column generation algorithm based on cutting stock problem. The MILP.py is a mixed integer linear programming model for the cutting stock problem, while the ColumnGeneration.py solves this problem using column generation algorithm.

Cutting Stock Problem
